// we can do this by using distributive conditional type

// const a4Type: A4 = "shair";

// however things changed when we combine a generic and a conditional type like this: this is what i'm talking above in A4 type comment
type OnlyString<T> = T extends string ? T : never; // this will return string because we are distributing the type T
type A5 = OnlyString<ASimpleUnion>; // this will return only string because we are distributing the type ASimpleUnion A4 still return never because we are not distributing the type in A4
// basically we are filter out that was't a string
// we treated each of the element in ASimpleUnion individually in A5

// let's combe back to the original example instead of creating an array that could be anyone of the array e.g. ASimpleUnion[] we want to create a union of each type wrapped in an array e.g. string[] number[]

// we need to combine the both the conditional type and generic type but here is a catch what would be the condition
// so actually we don't need a condition we are just triggering the distributive behavior of the type

type ToArray<T> = T extends T ? Array<T> : never;

// Adding this line later we have to pass a union in the generic parameters we should not do it like pass the type Object and then get the keys of that object in this way it will not work.

// we can do this by wrapping the both sides of an extends in tuple [T] extends [T]

// at this point ts don't know about anything about the type of T generic cuz we have not called the someFunction when we call someFunction with argument then ts will know about the type generic T

type AUnion = string | number | never;
// never is used to filter the unions
// and never is not included in AUnion type

// Exclude works on unions and Omit works on objects

type Exclude<T, U> = T extends U ? never : T;
// Question : as we know that Exclude works on unions so we provide first a set of unions like ("A"|"B"|"C"|"D") as T and the other one which we want to exclude is let's say "C"|"B" so the question is that on the right side of type (T extends U ? never : T) how do we know that weather we need to put T on left side of extend or right side of extends same as for U how we know that
// Answer : the answer is that see basically we are much like iterating in conditionals like above we have to put that type to left side which have more unions means the main union type from which we want to remove here i'm not just talking about the Exclude i'm talking in general wherever we use extends

/*
here is how it works 

// it will compare the each element of a Union Type T which is on left side with the whole Union type of which is on right side of extends
"A" extends "C"|"B" ? never : "A" => "A"
"B" extends "C"|"B" ? never : "B" => never
"C" extends "C"|"B" ? never : "C" => never
"D" extends "C"|"B" ? never : "D" => "D"
