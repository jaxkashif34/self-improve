/*
The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible 
interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two different interfaces, 
converting the interface of a class into one that the client expects. This is 
useful when you want to use an existing class but its interface doesnâ€™t match what 
your code needs. The adapter wraps the incompatible class, translating its methods 
into those that the client can use, without modifying the original class. It helps 
in achieving code reusability and flexibility when integrating with third-party 
libraries or legacy systems.

// ############### Without pattern Example ###############

// Existing MediaPlayer interface, which supports only MP4 files
interface MediaPlayer {
  playMP4(filename: string): void;
}

// Concrete class that implements the existing MediaPlayer interface
class MP4Player implements MediaPlayer {
  playMP4(filename: string): void {
    console.log(`Playing MP4 file: ${filename}`);
  }
}

// Client code that can only work with MP4 players
const player: MediaPlayer = new MP4Player();
player.playMP4("example.mp4"); // This works fine

// But if we want to support VLC files:
class VLCPlayer {
  playVLC(filename: string): void {
    console.log(`Playing VLC file: ${filename}`);
  }
}

// Client code cannot use VLCPlayer directly because the interfaces are incompatible
// @ts-expect-error
player.playVLC('example.vlc');  // Error: This method does not exist

// ############### With pattern Example ###############

// Adapter: Makes VLCPlayer compatible with MediaPlayer
class VLCPlayerAdapter implements MediaPlayer {
  private vlcPlayer: VLCPlayer;

  constructor(vlcPlayer: VLCPlayer) {
    this.vlcPlayer = vlcPlayer; // Injecting the adaptee (VLCPlayer)
  }

  // Adapting the playVLC method to the playMP4 interface
  playMP4(filename: string): void {
    this.vlcPlayer.playVLC(filename); // Delegating the call to VLCPlayer
  }
}

// Now the client can use VLCPlayer through the MediaPlayer interface
const vlcPlayer = new VLCPlayer();
const vlcAdapter: MediaPlayer = new VLCPlayerAdapter(vlcPlayer);

vlcAdapter.playMP4("example.vlc"); // Output: Playing VLC file: example.vlc
