// here is the trick to convert decimal to binary
// first we need to start with 1 and keep doubling it and stop there when double the number become greater then the given number
// let's say given number to convert is 14 so we keep double 1 until we read 8 we will not double 8 because if we double it. it will become greater then 14 which is 16
// then we have to observer that which numbers makes 14 (by addition) when we find that numbers write 1 under that numbers and write 0 under remaining numbers

// 14
// 8   4   2   1
// 1   1   1    0  ----> this is the binary of 14
